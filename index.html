    <h3>I - Mara</h3>
    <p>I am Mara, I am 16, and at lunch.</p>
    <p>
        "Hey look at Mara. She's gonna explode! She's so fuckin mad right now,
        oh my God!" Exclaims Kandi, the snobby popular girl.
        <br>
        "Why don't you just shut the fuck up?" I respond, one of the rare times
        I do.
        <br>
        "Oh, look who's going to be a big girl," she retorts. I stop thinking.
        I am already on top of her, her face unrecognizable. People try to stop
        me but I don't care. I keep punching her. Again and again, I don't stop.
        Two of my friends manage to pry me off of her.
        <br>
        "What are you doing!? You're fucking killing her!" Yelled the stronger
        of the two, Lilith.
        <br>
        "Whole point, Lil."
    </p>

    <h3>II - Kandi</h3>
    <p>
        I wake up in a hospital bed. The ceiling above me is white, too bright,
        and the smell of antiseptic burns my nose. My jaw aches, my lips feel swollen,
        and when I try to move, pain shoots through my ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
        A nurse notices my eyes open. “You're awake,” she says
        softly, adjusting the IV line taped to my arm. “Don't try to
        sit up yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Confusion floods me. The last thing I remember is Mara's face, twisted
        with rage, her fists coming down again and again. I thought she was weak.
        I thought she'd never fight back.
    </p>
    <p>Now, I'm here.</p>
    <p>
        My mom bursts into the room, mascara streaked down her cheeks. “Kandi!”
        she cries, clutching my hand. “Do you have any idea how scared I
        was? They said you—” She stops, choking on the words.
    </p>
    <p>
        I want to say something sharp, something to prove I'm still me,
        still untouchable. But my voice cracks, and all that comes out is a whisper:
        “She tried to kill me.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The nurse exchanges a look with my mom. I catch it. Pity. Fear. Judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
        And suddenly, I'm not the queen of the cafeteria anymore. I'm
        just a girl in a hospital bed, broken, wondering if Mara's fury will
        follow me even here.
    </p>

    <h3>III - Lilith</h3>
    <p>
        It all happened in less than a second. I don't even know what it was.
        She just said it was the whole point. What did she mean? The point of it
        all was to hurt Kandi? Why? It's not like she did anything that bad. It
        was only that one time as well.
    </p>
    <p>If Mars isn't gonna be receptive, someone will.</p>

    <h3>IV - Mara</h3>
    <p>
        The silence after is louder than the screaming had been. My knuckles throb,
        skin split, but I don't feel it. I don't feel anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        They keep asking me why. Teachers, friends, even Lil with her wide, terrified
        eyes. But how do I explain something I don't understand myself?
    </p>
    <p>
        It wasn't about Kandi. Not really. It was about every smirk, every
        whisper, every time I swallowed the words I wanted to spit back. She was
        just the spark. I was the fire waiting to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now everyone looks at me differently. Some with fear, some with disgust,
        a few with awe. I don't know which is worse.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hear that Kandi's in the hospital. Part of me wants to care. Part
        of me wants to say I'm sorry. But another part - the part that took
        over - just whispers, "it was worth it"
    </p>
    <p>And that scares me more than anything.</p>

    <h3>V - Kandi - two days later</h3>
    <p>
        I finally got discharged. I check my phone. People are still talking about
        it. Sometimes I agree with Mara. Sometimes I believe people should just
        shut the fuck up.
    </p>
    <p>
        My boyfriend left while I was in the hospital. That's just fucking peachy,
        if you ask me. I'm still bed bound for two weeks. Lily told me that Mara
        got suspended. I get that things were hard for her. I just never got the
        extent. I don't think Mara is okay. I want to help.
    </p>
    <p>
        I look at my phone background. Mara, Lily, and I, all together and smiling.
        That was three years ago. Something inside me wants that.
    </p>

    <h2>
		Memory I - The Picture
	</h2>
    <h4 style="font-style: italic;">Mara, Lilith, and Kandi, sixth grade:</h4>
    <p>
        "I think we should take a picture!"
        <br>
        "Good idea, Mars!"
        <br>
        "Yeah! Let's do it!"
        <br>
        "3, 2, 1, smile!"
        <br>
        "Oh my god it's so good! I'm gonna set it as my phone background!"
        <br>
        "Eh. I've taken better."
        <br>
        "Come on, Mars. Don't be so hard on yourself."
    </p>

    <h3>VI - Mara</h3>
    <p>
        Honestly, what the fuck. My mom won't leave me the fuck alone. Something
        about "she was only joking". I don't give two shits. She deserved it.
    </p>
    <p>-two weeks later, at school-</p>
    <p>
        Oh my god... She looks like shit... Fuck. Pull yourself together, Mars.
        You already did it. Can't change or fix it. Shikata ga nai...
    </p>

    <h3>VII - Lilith</h3>
    <p>Something happened. Mara's quiet. She's never quiet. Oh shit.</p>

    <h3>VIII - Kandi</h3>
    <p>
        She isn't talking to me. Makes sense. Lily said I need to try to let her
        get over it by herself. I come back to school from being bed bound and...
        Never mind. I'm gonna do something. I'm gonna talk to her.
        <br>
        "Hey Mara, uh..."
        <br>
        "Stay away. I don't want to hurt you again."
        <br>
        Ok she's definitely up to something. Screw it. Let her get over it herself?
        Sure, Lil. Sure.
    </p>

    <h3>IX - Mara</h3>
    <p>
        She talked to me. Why? I don't deserve to be conversed with. It's not
        her proble-
        <br>
        "hey. How's it?"
        <br>
        "who the fu-"
        <br>
        "Aidan. You?"
        <br>
        "Mara. And I-"
        <br>
        "You have quite the reputation here."
        <br>
        Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up. Why won't he stop?
        <br>
        "I have a project and was willing if you would participate?"
        <br>
        "Why the fuck would I? Please, leave me be."
        <br>
        Why did I say that, why did I say th-
        <br>
        "Because you get credits for this. Half a credit. The same as one elective.
        Off of this assignment."
        <br>
        "Ugh. Fine. What was your name? Kaiden?"
        <br>
        "Aidan"
        <br>
        "Close enough. What do you want?"
        <br>
        "Just ten questions."
    </p>

    <h3>X - Aidan</h3>
    <p>God she's fine. Shame she doesn't want to be near anyone. We'll see I guess.</p>

    <h3>XI - Mara - twenty minutes later</h3>
    <p>
        "alright. Question ten. Will you go out with me?"
        <br>
        What? He... I barely even know him. Wait. He's the same Aidan from last
        year. Shiiiiit...
        <br>
        "you can say no, its-"
        <br>
        "I... I'm not into guys. Sorry."
        <br>
        "O-oh... Okay..."
    </p>

    <h3>XII — Aidan</h3>
    <p>
        I kick my shoes off the second I get home, gym bag hitting the floor with
        a thud. Mom yells something about “don't leave your stuff there,”
        but it's background noise. My brain's still stuck in that hallway
        with Mara.
    </p>
    <p>I flop onto my bed, stare at the ceiling, and replay the moment for the hundredth time.</p>
    <p>“Question ten. Will you go out with me?”</p>
    <p>God. I actually said that. Out loud. To her face.</p>
    <p>
        I bury my hands over my eyes and groan. Who asks someone out like it's
        part of a survey? I swear I'm not usually that awkward. I mean, I've
        asked girls out before. Not often, but enough to know you're supposed
        to… I don't know… ease into it?
    </p>
    <p>
        But with Mara, my brain just short-circuited. She was sitting there,
        answering my questions with that flat, tired voice, looking like she'd
        rather be anywhere else. And I thought, hey, perfect time to shoot my shot.
    </p>
    <p>Genius.</p>
    <p>
        I roll onto my side and stare at my phone. No notifications. Not that
        I expected any. It's not like she'd text me “sorry for
        rejecting you” or something.
    </p>
    <p>And honestly? She handled it way better than I deserved.</p>
    <p>“I'm not into guys.”</p>
    <p>
        She said it so calmly. No embarrassment. No apology. Just… truth.
        Straightforward. Respectful. More mature than I was being, that's
        for sure.
    </p>
    <p>I exhale, long and slow.</p>
    <p>
        I'm not mad. I'm not even disappointed in the way I thought
        I'd be. It's weird — I feel kind of relieved. Like, okay,
        cool, that's the answer. No guessing. No wondering. No “maybe
        if I'd said it differently.”
    </p>
    <p>Just… clarity.</p>
    <p>
        And now that I'm thinking about it, she didn't look scared.
        Or annoyed. Or disgusted. She just looked… tired. Like she's
        been carrying something heavy for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everyone talks about her like she's some kind of monster. Like she's
        dangerous. But sitting across from her today? She didn't seem dangerous.
        She seemed… lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't know what happened between her and Kandi. I don't
        know why she snapped. I don't know why she walks around like she's
        bracing for impact.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I know this: She didn't deserve rumors. She didn't deserve
        fear. And she definitely didn't deserve me dropping a confession on
        her like a dumb plot twist.
    </p>
    <p>I grab my pillow and shove my face into it.</p>
    <p>“Bro,” I mumble into the fabric, “you really asked her out like it was extra credit.”</p>
    <p>I laugh. It's stupid. It's embarrassing. But it's also kind of funny.</p>
    <p>
        And maybe — just maybe — I'll try talking to her again.
        Not to ask her out. Not to flirt. Just… to talk. Like a normal person.
        Like someone who actually sees her.
    </p>
    <p>But not tomorrow. Tomorrow I'm keeping my mouth shut. For once.</p>

    <h3>XIII — Kandi</h3>
    <p>
        You know, I deserved it. I was being a bitch. Sure, we used to be best
        friends. But that was through middle school. Things change, Kandaria. Adapt.
    </p>
    <p>Adapt.</p>
    <p>
        My father's favorite word. He'd toss a pillow at me when I
        cried.
        <br>
        “Adapt.”
        <br>
        I lose my phone?
        <br>
        “Adapt.”
        <br>
        He takes it?
        <br>
        “Adapt.”
    </p>
    <p>
        It used to be annoying. Then it became a warning. A countdown. A reminder
        that whatever happened next was my fault for not adjusting fast enough.
    </p>
    <p>I never thought he would—</p>
    <p>“KANDARIA LEE MONARA, DOWNSTAIRS! NOW! BRING YOUR PHONE TOO!”</p>
    <p>My stomach drops so hard I swear it hits the floor before I do.</p>
    <p>
        I grab my phone with shaking hands and walk downstairs, each step louder
        than it should be. My brother is standing off to the side, arms crossed,
        eyes wide like he didn't mean for this to blow up. Liar.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dad's waiting in the living room, jaw clenched, face red. Mom's
        hovering behind him, wringing her hands like she's trying to disappear.
    </p>
    <p>“What's this about your brother saying you're talking to guys!?”</p>
    <p>
        Oh.
        <br>
        Oh, perfect.
        <br>
        Of course that's what this is about.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not the hospital.
        <br>
        Not the fight.
        <br>
        Not the fact that I can barely sleep without hearing Mara's voice
        in my head.
    </p>
    <p>
        No.
        <br>
        It's the crime of speaking to someone with a Y chromosome.
    </p>
    <p>I swallow hard. My throat feels like sandpaper.</p>
    <p>“I wasn't— It wasn't like that—”</p>
    <p>Dad steps closer. Too close.</p>
    <p>“Don't lie to me.”</p>
    <p>
        I wasn't lying. Not really. But it doesn't matter. In this
        house, truth is whatever he decides it is.
    </p>
    <p>
        My brother won't look at me.
        <br>
        Mom won't look at him.
        <br>
        And I'm standing here wishing I could just… evaporate.
    </p>
    <p>“Give me the phone,” Dad says.</p>
    <p>
        Of course.
        <br>
        Of course that's where this was going.
    </p>
    <p>
        I hand it over. My fingers brush his palm, and I flinch before I can stop
        myself.
    </p>
    <p>
        He notices.
        <br>
        He always notices.
    </p>
    <p>“Adapt,” he mutters.</p>
    <p>And I swear something inside me cracks so quietly no one else hears it.</p>
    <p>But I do.</p>

    <h3>XIV — Lilith</h3>
    <p>
        People keep acting like the fight happened to them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whispers in the hall.
        <br>
        Side-eyes.
        <br>
        Teachers pretending not to stare at Mara like she's a grenade with
        the pin halfway out.
    </p>
    <p>
        But I was there.
        <br>
        I pulled her off.
        <br>
        I felt her shaking.
        <br>
        I felt her muscles locked so tight it was like trying to hold down a wild
        animal that didn't want to be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
        And I still don't know what scared me more — how strong she
        was, or how empty her eyes looked when she said, “Whole point, Lil.”
    </p>
    <p>
        I keep replaying it.
        <br>
        Not the punches.
        <br>
        Not Kandi screaming.
        <br>
        Not the blood.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just Mara's voice.
        <br>
        Flat.
        <br>
        Cold.
        <br>
        Like she wasn't even in her own body.
    </p>
    <p>
        Everyone's talking about Kandi now.
        <br>
        About her dad.
        <br>
        About her being gone for a day, then two, then back again looking like
        she's made of glass.
    </p>
    <p>
        And Mara…
        <br>
        Mara's quieter than I've ever seen her. 
		<br>
		Not angry quiet. 
		<br>
		Not sulking quiet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Just… gone quiet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Like someone turned the volume down on her soul.
	</p>
	<p>
		I see her in the hallway sometimes. 
		<br>
		She doesn't look at me. 
		<br>
		She doesn't look at anyone. 
		<br>
		She walks like she's trying not to take up space.
	</p>
	<p>
		And I want to say something. 
		<br>
		Anything.
	</p>
	<p>
		But what do you say to someone who almost killed your friend? 
		<br>
		What do you say to someone who used to laugh with you in sixth grade over
		stupid selfies? 
		<br>
		What do you say to someone who looks like they're drowning but keeps
		insisting they're fine?
	</p>
	<p>
		I don't know.
	</p>
	<p>
		I just know this: 
		<br>
		Mara's not okay. 
		<br>
		Kandi's not okay. 
		<br>
		And I'm stuck in the middle, trying to hold two halves of a broken
		thing that don't fit together anymore.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wish someone would tell me what I'm supposed to do. 
		<br>
		Be loyal? 
		<br>
		Be honest? 
		<br>
		Be scared?
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm all three. 
		<br>
		And none of them help.
	</p>
	<h3>
		XV - Kandi
	</h3>
	<p>
		It's been a couple days. I have been alright. But whenever I try to talk
		to Mars it's:
		<br>
		"go away"
		<br>
		"aren't you done?"
		<br>
		"when will you learn, I want you to fuck off"
		<br>
		... Girl, I'm Trying! Unlike you, who's just sitting there like you don't
		want to exi-
	</p>
	<p>
		"Hey Kandi, can you-"
	</p>
	<p>
		The words leave my mouth before I even know I'm saying them.
	</p>
	<p>
		“FUCK OFF, DYLAN! NOBODY EVEN LIKES YOU!”
	</p>
	<p>
		Silence.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not the normal kind. 
		<br>
		The heavy kind. 
		<br>
		The kind that drops over a room like a curtain.
	</p>
	<p>
		My brother freezes in the doorway, eyes wide, mouth half-open like
		he expected me to snap but not like that. Mom looks up from the sink, startled.
		Even the stupid fridge hum seems to pause.
	</p>
	<p>
		And suddenly I'm aware of everything at once:
	</p>
	<p>
		My heartbeat in my ears. 
		<br>
		My hands shaking. 
		<br>
		The heat crawling up my neck. 
		<br>
		The way Dylan's face twists — not angry, not smug, just…
		hurt.
	</p>
	<p>
		Great. 
		<br>
		Perfect. 
		<br>
		Add that to the list of things I've ruined this month.
	</p>
	<p>
		He stammers, “I—I just wanted to ask if you were done with
		the charger—”
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course. 
		<br>
		Of course it was something stupid. 
		<br>
		Of course I blew up over nothing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I squeeze my eyes shut. My throat feels tight, like I swallowed a fist.
	</p>
	<p>
		“I didn't—” I start, but the words die. I don't
		even know what I'm trying to say. Sorry? Shut up? Leave me alone?
		All of them? None?
	</p>
	<p>
		Dylan backs away slowly, like I'm a wild animal he doesn't
		want to spook.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mom opens her mouth like she's going to say something comforting,
		but she closes it again. She knows better. Or maybe she's just tired.
		We all are.
	</p>
	<p>
		I sink into the nearest chair, elbows on my knees, palms pressed to my
		forehead.
	</p>
	<p>
		God. 
		<br>
		What is wrong with me?
	</p>
	<p>
		I wasn't even mad at him. 
		<br>
		Not really.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was mad at Mara. 
		<br>
		At myself. 
		<br>
		At Dad. 
		<br>
		At the whispers. 
		<br>
		At the way everyone looks at me like I'm fragile glass or a cautionary
		tale.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was mad at the fact that I keep trying and Mara keeps pushing me away
		like I'm poison.
	</p>
		<p>
		And Dylan just… walked into the blast radius.
	</p>
	<p>
		I take a shaky breath.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Adapt,” Dad would say.
	</p>
	<p>
		But right now? 
		<br>
		Right now I don't want to adapt. 
		<br>
		I want to scream. 
		<br>
		I want someone to understand. 
		<br>
		I want Mara to stop shutting me out. 
		<br>
		I want my life back. 
		<br>
		I want… something. Anything.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead, I sit there, staring at the floor, feeling the anger drain out
		of me and leave something worse behind.
	</p>
	<p>
		Want.
	</p>

	<h3>
		XVI - Mara
	</h3>
	<p>
		People keep staring at me like I'm a loaded weapon someone forgot
		to lock up. 
		<br>
		Whatever. I'm used to it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I'm at my locker, pretending to look for something I don't
		actually need, when two freshmen walk by whispering way too loudly.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Did you hear Kandi yelled at her brother?” 
		<br>
		“Like, full-on screamed at him.” 
		<br>
		“Yeah, my cousin said she snapped. Over nothing.”
	</p>
	<p>
		I freeze with my hand on a binder I don't remember putting there.
	</p>
	<p>
		Kandi yelled? 
		<br>
		At her brother?
	</p>
	<p>
		Kandi doesn't yell. 
		<br>
		She gets sharp, sure. Snarky. Annoyed. But yelling? That's…
		not her.
	</p>
	<p>
		I shut my locker a little too hard. The clang echoes down the hall.
	</p>
	<p>
		I shouldn't care. 
		<br>
		I shouldn't even be listening.
	</p>
	<p>
		But my brain won't let it go.
	</p>
	<p>
		She's been trying to talk to me for days. 
		<br>
		And I've been giving her the same answers every time:
	</p>
	<p>
		“Go away.” 
		<br>
		“Aren't you done?” 
		<br>
		“I want you to fuck off.”
	</p>
	<p>
		I meant it. 
		<br>
		I think I meant it.
	</p>
	<p>
		But hearing she snapped at someone else—someone who wasn't
		me—makes something twist in my chest. Something uncomfortable. Something
		I don't want to name.
	</p>
	<p>
		She's not supposed to break. 
		<br>
		Kandi's the one who adapts. 
		<br>
		She's the one who survives her house, her dad, her everything.
	</p>
	<p>
		If she's cracking now…
	</p>
	<p>
		Is that because of me?
	</p>
	<p>
		I lean against the lockers and pull my hood up, even though we're
		indoors and it's against the rules. I don't care.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Fine,” I mutter under my breath. “I guess I can be
		a human.”
	</p>
	<p>
		Whatever that means.
		<br>
